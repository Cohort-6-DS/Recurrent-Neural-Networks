# Recurrent-Neural-Networks

Before using RNN with text data, we must become familiar with one-hot-encoding, the most common NLP data prep technique. 

Practice along with the one-hot-encoding.ipynb to understand how to use Keras to do this. 

The challenge in the undersanding rnn notebook is that currently the data processing and network architecture are not optimal and is producing an accuracy of only 80%. Experiment with different processing and architechtures to maximize the accuracy.
